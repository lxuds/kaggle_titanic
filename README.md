In this competition, we were asked to predict what sorts of people would survive in the Titanic tragedy. 

Data: 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew were killed after the Titanic sank. The training sets are labeled, and include the informatin of 891 passengers, such as Sex, Age, Fare, Ticket class, Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic, etc. The testing sets contain the same information for 418 passengers. You may find the data and more description at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

Since the dataset is small and algorithms are relatively simple, We used iPython notebook to perform preprossessing and data visualization  for this project. 

First step: Data Visualization and Preprossessing. 

Second step: Trained the training sets, and ran cross validation. We used a stacker classifier (second-level model) to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.

At last, we make predictions on the testing sets.
